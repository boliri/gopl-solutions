The performance of bit vector sets clearly oustands their map-based counterpart.
Every single set operation is way faster if using bit vectors, even if the chosen word size is really large.

Obviously, the performance of bit vectors gets worse as the word size grows, but if we compare it to map sets under the
same circumstances it's WAY better.

You can have a look at the benchmarks folder to see actual data and compare both implementations. Each benchmark defines a set size
and a closed interval that specifies the min and max value of each element in the set.
